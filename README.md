# ZandoChess
ZandoChess is an attempt to make a chess program that can handle a decent gambit of Fairy Chess games and chess problems. Most chess programs seem to lack the user-end customizability to create your own chess problems or pieces that move in unusual ways. This program will be able to load in user-defined games with custom board sizes, piece types, and win conditions, among a few other things. Here is the path:

Post 1: A standard chess game. (In progress)

Post 2: Implement several variants like Fischer Chess and Chaturanga, for example.

Post 3: Let the program input some user-editable file to define the game. Probably XML.

Post 4: Let the program allow users to edit games within a GUI and save them, so they can be played.

Post 5: Add graphical packs, and possibly another GUI besides the current 2D board.

Post 6: Add very unusual things like multiple boards that connect in different ways, multidimensionality, and possibly even non square spaces. Perhaps the board with not be a 2D array but rather a directed graph.
